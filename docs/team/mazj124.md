### Project: SEPlanner

SEPlanner is a lightweight desktop application for Computer Engineering undergraduates from NUS to plan for the Student

* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
  * Added `ParseCondition` class to check for various invalid inputs from users, and refactored classes in `Parser` package based on this. (Pull requests [#270](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/270), [#272](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/pull/272))

* **Testing**:
    * Added JUnit tests for `AddCommandParser` and `RemoveCommandParser` to ensure correct behavior against invalid inputs by users.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the university and module related classes
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added introduction about university and module related classes
        * Added class diagrams for university and module related classes
        * Added sequence diagram for `searchmap` command 
        * Added section about possible future updates of the product
