## Design & implementation

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above explains the high-level design of the App. 

## Product scope
### Target user profile

__SEPlanner__ is targeted at Computer Engineering students in NUS planning for their Student Exchange Program (SEP). 

### Value proposition

Student Exchange is one of the most stressful and difficult things to plan for in a NUS students life. 
With multiple sources of information and a frustrating webpage to navigate, SEPlanner aims to organise 
a list of potential exchange Universities based on the users study plan, module requirements and personal preference.
